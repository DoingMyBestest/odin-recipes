Recipes website for The Odin Project!

This website will showcase my increasing skillset of using html coding skills
that I have acquired from The Odin Project.

I will show that I can create a repository on github, create a properly
formatted folder structure, create a boilerplate website from memory and
use skills I learn from this current lesson to create and design a recipe website as instructed by The Odin Project.
