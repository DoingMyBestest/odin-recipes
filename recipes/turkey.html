        <p>A simple roast turkey. Seasoned with salt 
            and pepper and basted with turkey stock, 
            the flavors of the turkey really stand out.</p>
            
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>    

        <ul>
            <li>Turkey</li>
            <li>Stuffing</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Turkey Stock</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the turkey by removing the neck and giblets.
                Pat the turkey dry with paper towels, then place it
                (breast-side up) on a rack in a roasting pan.
            </li>
            <li>Fill the cavity with stuffing. Rub the skin with
                butter, then season with salt and pepper. Pour
                two cups of stock into the roasting pan and
                loosely tent the turkey with foil.
            </li>
            <li>Roast the turkey, basting with stock every 30
                minutes, for about two and a half hours. Add more
                stock as the drippings evaporate. Remove the foil
                and continue roasting until the meat thermometer
                inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads
                165 degrees F (73 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy your meal!</li>
        </ol>
