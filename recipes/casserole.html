        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Nobody makes casserole like your Grandma. That's why this old-fashioned
           with egg noodles is always such a hit! It's made with ingredients you
           already have on hand (and, of course, a little bit of love).
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>White Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Garlic Salt</li>
            <li>Egg Noodles (or any pasta)</li>
            <li>Sour Cream</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and
                stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and
                crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.
            </li>
            <li>Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into
                the ground beef; simmer until flavors blend, about 20
                minutes. Remove from the heat, cover the skillet, and
                cool to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly
                salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling
                water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but
                firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.
            </li>
            <li>While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to
                350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
                casserole dish.
            </li>
            <li>Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/2 of the egg noodles into a prepared casserole dish.
                Top with 1/2 of the source cream mixture, then 1/2 of the
                ground beef mixture. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle
                Cheddar cheese over top.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven until cheese is melted and
                golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
